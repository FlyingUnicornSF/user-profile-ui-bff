# Start of Backend For Frontend

Backend for frontend was developed to shift API calls and data wrangling within browser script to server script to aim faster loading, quicker data structure modification to fit UI development needs, and to provide reusable data structures.

@app.route('/spec') returns quick summary of paths/discriptions/method/versions of services that are used for the route.

Each routing section shall have following sections:

- @app.route
- Synopsis
- Reference docs
  - link to github spec or readme
- API calls
  - method and service
- Data wrangling
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wikiData_wrangling
- Response
  - shape of response

## @app.route('/fetchUserProfile/< userID >')

### Synopsis:
With userID of the profile, it returns the full information (which is documented as "UnspecifiedObject" in UserProfile.spec).

### Reference docs:

https://github.com/kbase/user_profile/blob/master/UserProfile.spec

### API calls:

1. POST request to user profile rpc

### Data wrangling:

- user profile service does not return keys that does not contain matching value. Add them on so that browser script does not require to check if it is 'undefined".

### Response:

### Synopsis:

With one of following parameters: mine, shared, and public, it returns narratives with narrative detail.

### Reference Docs:

-   https://kbase.us/services/ws/docs/Workspace.html#typedefWorkspace.ObjectIdentity
-   https://github.com/kbaseapps/NarrativeService/blob/master/NarrativeService.spec

### API calls:

1. POST request to service wizard to get dynamic service URL
2. POST request to narrative service to get list of narratives
